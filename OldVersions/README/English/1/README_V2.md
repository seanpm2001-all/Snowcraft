# Snowcraft

This is a mirror of the flash game, which can be found at [http://nny.com/snowcraft/play/](http://nny.com/snowcraft/play/)

The mirrored content comes from [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/snowcraft_game)

```
Snowcraft, a simple game where the player controls 3 kids who have a snowball fight against computer-controlled teams with ever increasing number of players.
```

I am also attempting to make a recreation of the game that can run with [ruffle-rs](https://ruffle.rs/) ( [GitHub link for development](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle) )

***

## Install

The original game doesn't need to be installed, just click the `.exe` file and run it.

The new Ruffle-rs version will need to be viewed in Ruffle or another flash player.

***

## Compatibility

The original game does not run on Windows 11 or later. This game also may not work on later versions of Windows 10.
